Template file to add modules to dabotty

To add a module:
1. Create a new file in the modules folder
2. Copy this template into the new file
3. Add your code to the file
4. Anything you want the client to register (events for the most part) should be in the register function
5. Register will automatically be called on any module in the modules folder

Consult letsgo.py for a super simple example
